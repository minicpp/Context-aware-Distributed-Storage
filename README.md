# Context-aware-Distributed-Storage
We improve data access efficiency in mobile cloud storage by
exploring users' context information. Specifically, we optimize data
reading and writing on mobile devices from/to distributed cloud
storage according to network condition, user mobility pattern, and
data access preference. We propose a Reed-Solomon erasure code based
context-aware distributed storage system. Then, a mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) and a stable matching method are
proposed to optimize the system
efficiency. The proposed method is verified through various
simulation scenarios.
